This is the dbt project for a dataset about Fannie Mae's multifamily loans.

The two end datasets are `dim_loans` and `dim_properties`.

Read Fannie Mae's green bond program, and check out how I created this project, on my blog, [Verify Analytics](https://verifyanalytics.wordpress.com/).

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
